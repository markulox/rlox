## About
Recently, I've gain an interest in interpreter and compiler implementation. So I purchased the book 'Crafting Interpreters' by Robert Nystrom. This repository showcases my implementation of the first interpreter, also known as a Tree-Walker, as described in the book. However, I've chosen to write this version in Rust instead of Java to improve my Rust coding skill.
